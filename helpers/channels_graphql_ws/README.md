## Features

- WebSocket-based GraphQL server implemented on the
  [Django Channels v3](https://github.com/django/channels).
- WebSocket protocol is compatible with
  [Apollo GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql) client.
- [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)-like
  subscriptions.
- All GraphQL requests are processed concurrently (in parallel).
- Subscription notifications delivered in the order they were issued.
- Optional subscription activation message can be sent to a client. This
  is useful to avoid race conditions on the client side. Consider the
  case when client subscribes to some subscription and immediately
  invokes a mutations which triggers this subscription. In such case the
  subscription notification can be lost, cause these subscription and
  mutation requests are processed concurrently. To avoid this client
  shall wait for the subscription activation message before sending such
  mutation request.
- Customizable notification strategies:
    - A subscription can be put to one or many subscription groups. This
      allows to granularly notify only selected clients, or, looking
      from the client's perspective - to subscribe to some selected
      source of events. For example, imaginary subscription
      "OnNewMessage" may accept argument "user" so subscription will
      only trigger on new messages from the selected user.
    - Notification can be suppressed in the subscription resolver method
      `publish`. For example, this is useful to avoid sending
      self-notifications.
- All GraphQL "resolvers" run in the main eventloop. Asynchronous
  "resolvers" able to execute blocking calls with `asyncio.to_thread` or
  `channels.db.database_sync_to_async` wrappers.
- Resolvers (including subscription's `subscribe` & `publish`) can be
  represented both as synchronous or asynchronous (`async def`) methods.
- Subscription notifications can be sent from both synchronous and
  asynchronous contexts. Just call `MySubscription.broadcast()` or
  `await MySubscription.broadcast()` depending on the context.
- Clients for the GraphQL WebSocket server:
    - AIOHTTP-based client.
    - Client for unit test based on the Channels testing communicator.
- Requires Python 3.8 and newer. Tests run on 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.


## Installation

```shell
pip install django-channels-graphql-ws
```


## Getting started

Create a GraphQL schema using Graphene. Note the `MySubscription` class.

```python
import channels_graphql_ws
import graphene

class MySubscription(channels_graphql_ws.Subscription):
    """Simple GraphQL subscription."""

    # Leave only latest 64 messages in the server queue.
    notification_queue_limit = 64

    # Subscription payload.
    event = graphene.String()

    class Arguments:
        """That is how subscription arguments are defined."""
        arg1 = graphene.String()
        arg2 = graphene.String()

    @staticmethod
    def subscribe(root, info, arg1, arg2):
        """Called when user subscribes."""

        # Return the list of subscription group names.
        return ["group42"]

    @staticmethod
    def publish(payload, info, arg1, arg2):
        """Called to notify the client."""

        # Here `payload` contains the `payload` from the `broadcast()`
        # invocation (see below). You can return `None` if you wish to
        # suppress the notification to a particular client. For example,
        # this allows to avoid notifications for the actions made by
        # this particular client.

        return MySubscription(event="Something has happened!")

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Root GraphQL query."""
    # Graphene requires at least one field to be present. Check
    # Graphene docs to see how to define queries.
    value = graphene.String()
    async def resolve_value(self):
        return "test"

class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Root GraphQL mutation."""
    # Check Graphene docs to see how to define mutations.
    pass

class Subscription(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Root GraphQL subscription."""
    my_subscription = MySubscription.Field()

graphql_schema = graphene.Schema(
    query=Query,
    mutation=Mutation,
    subscription=Subscription,
)
```

Make your own WebSocket consumer subclass and set the schema it serves:

```python
class MyGraphqlWsConsumer(channels_graphql_ws.GraphqlWsConsumer):
    """Channels WebSocket consumer which provides GraphQL API."""
    schema = graphql_schema

    # Uncomment to send keepalive message every 42 seconds.
    # send_keepalive_every = 42

    # Uncomment to process requests sequentially (useful for tests).
    # strict_ordering = True

    async def on_connect(self, payload):
        """New client connection handler."""
        # You can `raise` from here to reject the connection.
        print("New client connected!")
```

Setup Django Channels routing:

```python
application = channels.routing.ProtocolTypeRouter({
    "websocket": channels.routing.URLRouter([
        django.urls.path("graphql/", MyGraphqlWsConsumer.as_asgi()),
    ])
})
```

Notify<sup>[﹡](#redis-layer)</sup> clients when some event happens using
the `broadcast()` or `broadcast_sync()` method from the OS thread where
there is no running event loop:

```python
MySubscription.broadcast(
    # Subscription group to notify clients in.
    group="group42",
    # Dict delivered to the `publish` method.
    payload={},
)
```

Notify<sup>[﹡](#redis-layer)</sup> clients in a coroutine function
with async `broadcast()` or `broadcast_async()` method:

```python
await MySubscription.broadcast(
    # Subscription group to notify clients in.
    group="group42",
    # Dict delivered to the `publish` method.
    payload={},
)
```

<a name="redis-layer">﹡)</a> In case you are testing your client code
by notifying it from the Django Shell, you have to setup a
[channel layer](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/channel_layers.html#configuration)
in order for the two instance of your application. The same applies in
production with workers.

You should prefer async resolvers and async middleware over sync ones.
Async versions will result in faster code execution. To do DB operations
you can use
[Django 4 asynchronous queries](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/async/).


## Example

You can find simple usage example in the [example](example/) directory.

Run:
```shell
cd example/
# Initialize database.
./manage.py migrate
# Create "user" with password "user".
./manage.py createsuperuser
# Run development server.
./manage.py runserver
```

Play with the API though the GraphiQL browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

You can start with the following GraphQL requests:
```graphql

# Check there are no messages.
query read { history(chatroom: "kittens") { chatroom text sender }}

# Send a message as Anonymous.
mutation send { sendChatMessage(chatroom: "kittens", text: "Hi all!"){ ok }}

# Check there is a message from `Anonymous`.
query read { history(chatroom: "kittens") { text sender } }

# Login as `user`.
mutation send { login(username: "user", password: "pass") { ok } }

# Send a message as a `user`.
mutation send { sendChatMessage(chatroom: "kittens", text: "It is me!"){ ok }}

# Check there is a message from both `Anonymous` and from `user`.
query read { history(chatroom: "kittens") { text sender } }

# Subscribe, do this from a separate browser tab, it waits for events.
subscription s { onNewChatMessage(chatroom: "kittens") { text sender }}

# Send something again to check subscription triggers.
mutation send { sendChatMessage(chatroom: "kittens", text: "Something ;-)!"){ ok }}
```


## Details

The `channels_graphql_ws` module provides the following key classes:

- `GraphqlWsConsumer`: Django Channels WebSocket consumer which
    maintains WebSocket connection with the client.
- `Subscription`: Subclass this to define GraphQL subscription. Very
    similar to defining mutations with Graphene. (The class itself is a
    "creative" copy of the Graphene `Mutation` class.)
- `GraphqlWsClient`: A client for the GraphQL backend. Executes strings
    with queries and receives subscription notifications.
- `GraphqlWsTransport`: WebSocket transport interface for the client.
- `GraphqlWsTransportAiohttp`: WebSocket transport implemented on the
    [AIOHTTP](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) library.

For details check the [source code](channels_graphql_ws/) which is
thoroughly commented. The docstrings of classes are especially useful.

Since the WebSocket handling is based on the Django Channels and
subscriptions are implemented in the Graphene-like style it is
recommended to have a look the documentation of these great projects:

- [Django Channels](http://channels.readthedocs.io)
- [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/)

The implemented WebSocket-based protocol was taken from the library
[subscription-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)
which is used by the [Apollo GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql).
Check the
[protocol description](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
for details.


### Automatic Django model serialization

The `Subscription.broadcast` uses Channels groups to deliver a message
to the `Subscription`'s `publish` method.
[ASGI specification](https://github.com/django/asgiref/blob/master/specs/asgi.rst#events)
clearly states what can be sent over a channel, and Django models are
not in the list. Since it is common to notify clients about Django
models changes we manually serialize the `payload` using
[MessagePack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python)
and hack the process to automatically serialize Django models following
the the Django's guide
[Serializing Django objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/serialization/).


### Execution

- Different requests from different WebSocket client are processed
  asynchronously.
- By default different requests (WebSocket messages) from a single
  client are processed concurrently in an event loop. So there is no
  guarantee that requests will be processed in the same order the client
  sent these requests. Actually, with HTTP we have this behavior for
  decades.
- It is possible to serialize message processing by setting
  `strict_ordering` to `True`. But note, this disables parallel requests
  execution - in other words, the server will not start processing a new
  request from the client until it finishes the current one. See
  comments in the class `GraphqlWsConsumer`. This mode is here primarily
  for testing.
- All subscription notifications are delivered in the order they were
  issued.
- Each request (WebSocket message) processing starts in the main thread.
  The request's parsing and validation is offloaded into the thread
  pool. Resolver calls made from the main thread. And for each resolver
  it checks whether the resolver is awaitable and `await` it if so.


### Context and scope

The context object (`info.context` in resolvers) is a `SimpleNamespace`
instance useful to transfer extra data between GraphQL resolvers. The
lifetime of `info.context` corresponds to the lifetime of GraphQL
request, so it does not persist content between different
queries/mutations/subscriptions. It also contains some useful extras:
- `graphql_operation_id`: The GraphQL operation id came from the client.
- `graphql_operation_name`: The name of GraphQL operation.
- `channels_scope`:
  [Channels scope](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/consumers.html#scope).
  Contrary to the `info.context`, the Channels scope corresponds to the
  WebSocket connection not to the GraphQL operation/request.
- `channel_name`: WebSocket channel name.


### Authentication

To enable authentication it is typically enough to wrap your ASGI
application into the  `channels.auth.AuthMiddlewareStack`:

```python
application = channels.routing.ProtocolTypeRouter({
    "websocket": channels.auth.AuthMiddlewareStack(
        channels.routing.URLRouter([
            django.urls.path("graphql/", MyGraphqlWsConsumer),
        ])
    ),
})
```

This gives you a Django user `info.context.channels_scope["user"]` in
all the resolvers. To authenticate user you can create a `Login`
mutation like the following:

```python
class Login(graphene.Mutation, name="LoginPayload"):
    """Login mutation."""

    ok = graphene.Boolean(required=True)

    class Arguments:
        """Login request arguments."""

        username = graphene.String(required=True)
        password = graphene.String(required=True)

    def mutate(self, info, username, password):
        """Login request."""

        # Ask Django to authenticate user.
        user = django.contrib.auth.authenticate(username=username, password=password)
        if user is None:
            return Login(ok=False)

        # Use Channels to login, in other words to put proper data to
        # the session stored in the scope.
        asgiref.sync.async_to_sync(channels.auth.login)(info.context.channels_scope, user)
        # Save the session,cause `channels.auth.login` does not do this.
        info.context.session.save()

        return Login(ok=True)
```

The authentication is based on the Channels authentication mechanisms.
Check
[the Channels documentation](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/authentication.html).
Also take a look at the example in the [example](example/) directory.


### The Python client

There is the `GraphqlWsClient` which implements GraphQL client working
over the WebSockets. The client needs a transport instance which
communicates with the server. Transport is an implementation of the
`GraphqlWsTransport` interface (class must be derived from it). There is
the `GraphqlWsTransportAiohttp` which implements the transport on the
[AIOHTTP](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) library. Here is an
example:

```python
transport = channels_graphql_ws.GraphqlWsTransportAiohttp(
    "ws://backend.endpoint/graphql/", cookies={"sessionid": session_id}
)
client = channels_graphql_ws.GraphqlWsClient(transport)
await client.connect_and_init()
result = await client.execute("query { users { id login email name } }")
users = result["data"]
await client.finalize()
```

See the `GraphqlWsClient` class docstring for the details.


### The GraphiQL client

The GraphiQL provided by Graphene doesn't connect to your GraphQL
endpoint via WebSocket; instead you should use a modified GraphiQL
template under `graphene/graphiql.html` which will take precedence over
the one of Graphene. One such modified GraphiQL is provided in the
[example](example/) directory.


### Testing

To test GraphQL WebSocket API read the
[appropriate page in the Channels documentation](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/testing.html).

In order to simplify unit testing there is a `GraphqlWsTransport`
implementation based on the Django Channels testing communicator:
`channels_graphql_ws.testing.GraphqlWsTransport`. Check its docstring
and take a look at the [tests](/tests) to see how to use it.


### Subscription activation confirmation

The original Apollo's protocol does not allow client to know when a
subscription activates. This inevitably leads to the race conditions on
the client side. Sometimes it is not that crucial, but there are cases
when this leads to serious issues.
[Here is the discussion](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/issues/451)
in the
[`subscriptions-transport-ws`](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)
tracker.

To solve this problem, there is the `GraphqlWsConsumer` setting
`confirm_subscriptions` which when set to `True` will make the consumer
issue an additional `data` message which confirms the subscription
activation. Please note, you have to modify the client's code to make it
consume this message, otherwise it will be mistakenly considered as the
first subscription notification.

To customize the confirmation message itself set the `GraphqlWsConsumer`
setting `subscription_confirmation_message`. It must be a dictionary
with two keys `"data"` and `"errors"`. By default it is set to
`{"data": None, "errors": None}`.


### GraphQL middleware

It is possible to inject middleware into the GraphQL operation
processing. For that define `middleware` setting of your
`GraphqlWsConsumer` subclass, like this:

```python
async def threadpool_for_sync_resolvers(next_middleware, root, info, *args, **kwds):
    """Offload synchronous resolvers to the threadpool.

    This middleware should always be the last in the middlewares calls
    stack and the closest to the real resolver. If this middleware is
    not the last it will check the next middleware to call instead of
    real resolver. The first middleware in the middlewares list will be
    the closest to the resolver.
    """
    # Invoke next middleware.
    if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(next_middleware):
        result = await next_middleware(root, info, *args, **kwds)
    else:
        result = await asyncio.to_thread(next_middleware, root, info, *args, **kwds)
    return result

class MyGraphqlWsConsumer(channels_graphql_ws.GraphqlWsConsumer):
    ...
    middleware = [threadpool_for_sync_resolvers]
```

It is recommended to write asynchronous middlewares. But synchronous
middlewares are also supported:

```python
def my_middleware(next_middleware, root, info, *args, **kwds):
    """My custom GraphQL middleware."""
    # Invoke next middleware.
    return next_middleware(root, info, *args, **kwds)

class MyGraphqlWsConsumer(channels_graphql_ws.GraphqlWsConsumer):
    ...
    middleware = [my_middleware]
```

For more information about GraphQL middleware please take a look at the
[relevant section in the Graphene documentation](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/execution/middleware/#middleware).


## Alternatives

There is a [Tomáš Ehrlich](https://gist.github.com/tricoder42)
GitHubGist
[GraphQL Subscription with django-channels](https://gist.github.com/tricoder42/af3d0337c1b33d82c1b32d12bd0265ec)
which this implementation was initially based on.

There is a promising
[GraphQL WS](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws)
library by the Graphene authors. In particular
[this pull request](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws/pull/9)
gives a hope that there will be native Graphene implementation of the
WebSocket transport with subscriptions one day.


## Development


### Bootstrap

_A reminder of how to setup an environment for the development._

1. Install PyEnv to be able to work with many Python versions at once
   [PyEnv→Installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
2. Install Python versions needed. The command should be executed in the
   project's directory:
   ```shell
   $ pyenv local | xargs -L1 pyenv install
   ```
3. Check that pyenv works correctly. The command:
   ```shell
   $ pyenv versions
   ```
   should show python versions enlisted in
   [.python-version](.python-version).  If everything is set up
   correctly pyenv will switch version of python when you enter and
   leave the project's directory. Inside the directory `pyenv which
   python` should show you a python installed in pyenv, outside the dir
   it should be the system python.
3. Install Poetry to the system Python.
   ```shell
   $ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```
   It is important to install Poetry into the system Python, NOT in your
   virtual environment. For details see Poetry docs: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
4. Create local virtualenv in `.venv`, install all project dependencies
   (from `pyproject.toml`) except the project itself.
   ```shell
   $ poetry install --no-root
   ```
5. Activate virtualenv
   There are options:
   - With Poetry:
     ```shell
     $ poetry shell
     ```
   - Manually:
     ```shell
     $ source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - With VS Code: Choose `.venv` with "Python: Select interpreter" and
     reopen the terminal.

6. Upgrade Pip:
   ```shell
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

### Where to start reading the code

The code is inherently complex because it glues two rather different
libraries/frameworks Channels and Graphene. You might need some time to
dive into. Here are some quick insights to help you to get on track.

The main classes are `GraphqlWsConsumer` and `Subscription`. The former
one is a Channels consumer which instantiates each time a WebSocket
connection establishes. User (of the library) subclasses it and tunes
settings in the successor class. The latter is from the Graphene world.
Both classes are tightly coupled. When client subscribes an instance of
`GraphqlWsConsumer` subclass holding the WebSocket connection passes to
the `Subscription`.

To better dive in it is useful to understand in general terms how
regular request are handled. When server receives JSON from the client,
the `GraphqlWsConsumer.receive_json` method is called by Channels
routines. Then the request passes to the `_on_gql_start` method which
handles GraphQL message "START". Most magic happens there.


### Running tests

_A reminder of how to run tests._

- Run all tests on all supported Python versions:
   ```shell
   $ tox
   ```
- Run all tests on a single Python version, e.g on Python 3.8:
   ```shell
   $ tox -e py38
   ```
- Example of running a single test:
   ```shell
   $ tox -e py310 -- tests/test_basic.py::test_main_usecase
   ```
- Running on currently active Python directly with Pytest:
   ```shell
   $ poetry run pytest
   ```


### Making release

_A reminder of how to make and publish a new release._

1. Merge all changes to the master branch and switch to it.
2. Update version: `poetry version minor`.
3. Update [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).
4. Update [README.md](./README.md) (if needed).
5. Commit changes made above.
6. Git tag: `git tag vX.X.X && git push --tags`.
7. Publish release to PyPI: `poetry publish --build`.
8. Update
   [release notes](https://github.com/datadvance/DjangoChannelsGraphqlWs/releases)
   on GitHub.
